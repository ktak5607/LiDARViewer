# LiDARViewer
A tool used to view LiDAR las files. This is a work in progress and currently is only capable of reading files. I have it working for files in LAS version 1.2, and will add support for the rest later. I started this project in Visual Studio, but for now I am only uploading the .cpp file because it's where I do all of the work currently.
